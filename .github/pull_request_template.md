## Note to contributor: 

Thank you for contributing. If this is a new ruleset and your first time contributing, congratulations! There will be some tests ran through our continuous integration in Travis. For example, checking for duplicate hosts and problematic hosts as well in the ruleset file. You will see this testing begin when you open this pull request.

If this is not your first time and you have open PRs that have not been closed or merged, please revisit them by searching: https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues?q=is%3Aopen+assignee%3A[username]. If there is something not being addressed by other maintainers or a project lead, link them to the PR with your question. Thank you for your patience.
